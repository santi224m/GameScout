      </p>
      <h1 id="process">How Do We Process Your Information?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>In Short: We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with
          you,
          for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other
          purposes with your consent.</em>

        <span>
          We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our
          Services, including:
        </span>
        <span class="dim"><strong>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user
            accounts.</strong> We may process your information so you can create and log in to your account, as well as
          keep your account in working order.
        </span>
        <span class="dim"><strong>To protect our Services.</strong> We may process your information as part of our
          efforts to keep our Services safe and secure, including fraud monitoring and prevention.</span>
      </p>
      <h1 id="share">When And With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section.</em>

        We will never share your information unless required to in a court of law.
      </p>
      <h1 id="keep">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy
          Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em>

        <span>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
          this
          Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
          other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
          longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</span>

        <span>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will delete such
          information.</span>
      </p>
      <h1 id="safe">How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
          security measures.</em>

        <span>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
          protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
          secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed
          to
          be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
          parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
          information.</span>
        <span>Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to
          and
          from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</span>
      </p>
      <h1 id="rights">What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h1>
      <p>
        <em>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country,
          province, or
          state of residence.</em>

        <span class="dim"><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your
          personal information, which may be
          express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
          any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in
          the
          section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.
        </span>

        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        <strong>Account Information</strong>

        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
        can:
      <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
        <li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>
      </ul>
      Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
      active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
      assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

      <h1 id="track">Controls For Do-Not-Track Features</h1>
      <p>
        <span>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
          feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
          browsing
          activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
          any other
          mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
          tracking is
          adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
          Privacy
          Notice.
        </span>
        <span>
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently
          is
          not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this
          time.

You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law.
